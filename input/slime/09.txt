I’ve Been Reincarnated as a Tentacle Slime~ I Want to Live a Comfortable, Secure Life and Do Whatever I Want~ - Chapter 9
The monster inhabiting the 4th floor was a wolf. It had a silver and white cur coat, a sharp face, and a slender body. Honestly, it looked cool. That wolf was staring at me as I clung to the ceiling. The plan for this time is as follows.

(I have a great idea. I’ll transform into a turtle, let the wolf bite me, then grow a spear in its mouth and stab it. After that, I’ll grow more spears inside its body to finish it off.)

I transformed into a turtle and began to threaten the wolf. As expected, the wolf lunged at me to bite.

(Just as planned, now all that’s left is to time the spear strike… Now!)

Just as I was about to grow a spear when it tried to bite, the wolf’s sharp instincts made it leap backward, narrowly avoiding the strike.

The wolf, now on guard, began growling and warning me with a low growl, ‘grr, grr, grr’.

At this point, there’s no choice but to face it head-on! I deploy four shields and form countless spears. The shields are arranged in all four directions, with a few spears assigned for defense and the rest for attack. The countless spear-tentacles I launch strike the wolf. However, the wolf’s movements are incredibly fast. It stomps on the tentacles, twists its body, and flicks them away with its tail, nearly avoiding all of them… A few of the spears grazed its body, but that was all.

(The wolf is unreal! It stomps on the tentacles attacking from behind like it’s nothing… How can it even do that? Is that even possible?)

The gap in skill was so overwhelming that I became flustered. Fortunately, the wolf was focused entirely on evading and didn’t attempt to attack, which was a small consolation.

How long has it been since I started fighting the wolf? Through this battle, I’ve gotten better at handling my tentacles. I used to rely on straight-line attacks, but now, I can mix curves and straight lines, allowing me to launch attacks from all directions—up, down, left, right, and front. No, I’ve been forced to learn this. Without this, I wouldn’t be able to land a hit on the wolf.

As my skill improved, the wolf started taking more hits. It accumulated numerous small wounds, gradually losing its agility as its white fur began to stain with red. And then… the wolf collapsed with a heavy thud. But its eyes weren’t dead; they glared at me.

“You were strong. Without you, I wouldn’t have become this strong. Thank you. Now I’ll devour you and grow even stronger.”

Perhaps the wolf understood. It stopped glaring at me and closed its eyes. I ended its suffering with a single blow.
