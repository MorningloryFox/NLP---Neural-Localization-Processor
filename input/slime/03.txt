I’ve Been Reincarnated as a Tentacle Slime~ I Want to Live a Comfortable, Secure Life and Do Whatever I Want~ - Chapter 3
As I leisurely walked down the middle of the path, I sensed a bat coming towards me.

(One, two, three, four, five bats!? This is bad! There’s no way I can win a 1v5.)

I moved to the edge of the wall and let them pass.

(How frustrating! I want to defeat them!)

Right now, I don’t have any hope of winning, but someday… I held the thought of defeating the bats in my heart and walked in the opposite direction.

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

Soon after, I found a lone bat. Alright, battle time! But wait a minute.

(I was planning to fight without a second thought, but is it really necessary to fight barehanded?)

If I were human, I wouldn’t fight an enemy of the same size barehanded unless I had confidence. Had I been influenced by the slime’s thinking without realizing it?

I decided to pull back and search for something that could be used as a weapon. There were quite a few things that could work, and I found several sharp stones. Considering our size, even a stone could make for a proper weapon.

Next, I used [Transmutation] to turn into a bat and activated the [Flight] skill. I flapped my wings and soared up, summoning five tentacles from my back. If I could fight in the air, I’d have an advantage with the extra tentacles.

In my bat form, I had three tentacles for attacking with stones and two for defense.

(Alright, I’ve prepared everything I can for now. Time to head to the battlefield!)

I sent a provocative ultrasonic wave toward the bat on the ceiling, triggering the start of the fight.

I used one tentacle as a decoy, deliberately letting it be bitten. When the bat bit down, I struck with my attacking tentacles. The bat’s head burst open with bl00d and it fell. I took some damage, but a prolonged fight wouldn’t be efficient.

(Alright, that worked out. The weight of the stone might have made the plan even more effective.)

I devoured the bat and began searching for my next prey.

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

Since then, I’ve won each one-on-one battle without much trouble. I’ve hunted 20 creatures so far. My tentacle speed has increased, and my body has grown about twice its size. My bat form has also doubled in size, and my flight speed has improved.

Another thing I realized was that the number of tentacles was not fixed at five. I could increase them as much as I wanted, or even reduce them to zero. However, if I increase them recklessly, each tentacle becomes thinner, and the density decreases. I believe eating more creatures will resolve the thickness issue. Currently, ten tentacles is the limit for combat.

(The preparations are complete. I’m going to challenge a group now!)

With determination, I soared and moved forward through the cave.

I came across two bats as I progressed. Using four tentacles for offense and two as decoys, I defeated them without any issues.

(The strength from 20 creatures is on a whole different level. It’s hard to believe how scared I was not long ago. Now, I can KO them with one hit to the head!)

After that, I won without difficulty in group battles like 1v3 and 1v4. In fact, with four opponents, they split into two front-line and two back-line, making them easier to defeat.

I finally found a group of five bats. I’m not sure if it’s the same party, but I’m going to take out my frustration on them.

(They’re probably going to split into groups of three and two. I’ll take down the three first, then deal with the two.)

I use a sonic wave to provoke them, and they start coming towards me. I throw the rocks I’ve stored in my body with my tentacles all at once. My bat form has gotten larger, so carrying the stones while flying is no problem. Two of the stones hit, sending two bat crashing down. Now, it’s 1v3. I strike the bat that dodged the rocks, leaving just two. One attempts to bite me, but I catch it with my tentacles and counter, leaving only one. It tries to escape, but I finish it off as it turns away.

(Alright! I can take on five at once!)

I continued my bat-slaying spree, and by the time the lights on the wall dimmed, I had consumed a total of 100 bats. As a result, my skills in Flight and Sonic Wave increased to Lv03.

The wall lights might indicate the time of day. Night battles would definitely put me at a disadvantage, so I’ll stop here. I hid inside a rock to wait for the lights to brighten again.
